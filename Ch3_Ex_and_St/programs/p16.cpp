// Write a program to create a customerâ€™s bill for a company. The company sells only three products: TV sets, DVD players, and remote controllers. The unit prices are $1400.00, $220.00, and $35.20, respectively. The program must read from the keyboard the quantity of each piece of equipment purchased. It then calculates the cost of each item, the subtotal, and the total cost after an 8.25 percent sales tax.
