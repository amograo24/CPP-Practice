<!-- what happens if i put `if` in ternary? -->
x=if(a>b) inp; Overhere, if (a < b),  then what will be the value of x? is this even valid? This sort of a statement

what happens if i enter a -ve value through cin for unsigned int?

if string is empty, then is it boolean false?
is just empty quotes boolean false?
is a empty array boolean false?
is a variable with no value a boolean false? is a variable with garbage value a boolean false?

80>=avg>=70 works? or should it be 70 < avg <= 80 or avg>70 && avg<=80
80>avg<60?

80<=avg<90 => 80<=True or 80<=False 


what happens if i do 3 < true? or -3 < false?

nested ternary expressions

(x>0)?(y>0?1:4):(y>0?2:3);

int days; days+=10. What happens here since days is not initialized?

swithc also accepts a single statement? whether simple or compound?

float values are made into boolean how?

is 0.00034 a true or a false? cause if it does type casting, it is technically 0, which is false.

cin seems to be taking multiple inputs without a space too sometimes. So is there a way it knows when to switch to the next type? can i enter all values without space? and it just recognizes when type changes?

what happens if i enter a float for int? 

try int string int
string int int

int char int int, but enter int char int char-int

what operations are expensive? division, modulo

cout in ternary? yess

multiple expressions instead of just 1 in ternary?

can if statement have an empty statement? if(a>b);
does C/C++ check indentation?

is this valid: case1: i++; m--; case2: i++; break; case3: i++; break; (this one lined syntax, is that's why fall through is allowed?)

is this valid: 
if(a>b) ; else cout << "else";
if(a>b) cout << "if" ; else ;

compound statements do not need semicolon na?

will this work:

if() st else {st}
if() st if() st else {st}
if/else long statement till semicolon?
what does left to right mean in unary associativity

what does 3 || 5 return? what does 3 && 5 return?

is just (); an empty expression?

!(x && y) and !(x || y), explain

0 && fjbjkdbfj or 1 || hiehfhehfhf, will these even cause compile time errors?

are boolean expressions with literals evaluated at compile time? or run time? If it has variables, then run time, if literals then compile time?

```case 3:

case 3:``` will it work?

case 3.44? works?

case (3): works?

is there some type casting happening in these cases if it is even valid? what sort of a value is expected in these cases?
what if i put variables there instead if literal integer values?

does the order in which the cases are defined matter? can it be 342189? can we skip integral values in between?

case 1: fjifuhj; case 2: jffh, is this basically like:

case 1:
    dhnfnfh;
    case 2:
        jffh;

is this why it's called a fall through system? IDTS, cause it can start directly from case 2, it doesn't start from case 1 na.
legally, can the whole C/C++ program be written in 1 line?

if a!=3; a=3 vs a==3 || (a=3) vs a!=3 && (a=3)

what happens if we put the default at the top? Is it logical error or synctactical error?
maybe default is like a wild card, for all values, therefore, all the cases will be ignored if a break is there, but what if no break? then fall through? default is something like if(1)?

<!-- is switch statement similar to an if? -->

can we put multiple options for test cases? case1,2 do this, case 6,7 do this

in ternary, can either of the expressions post the condition be empty?

what is meant by expr2 and expr3 must be the same type?

does if(ternary) make sense
