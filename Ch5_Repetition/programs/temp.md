PRG-5. Write a program that asks the user to enter two positive integers. The program then prints a list of even and a list of odd numbers between the given integers.

PRG-6. Write a program that prints all numbers between 1 and 100 that are divisible by 7.

PRG-7. Write a program that prints all numbers between 1 and 100 that are divisible by
both 5 and 7.

PRG-8. Write a program that reads a positive integer between 1 and 100 and prints its factors (divisors). A factor is a number that divides another number. For example, the factors of 10 are 1, 2, 5, and 10. The factors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12.

PRG-9. Write a program that reads two integers between 1 and 100 and prints their common factors (divisors).

PRG-10. Write a program that finds the greatest common divisor of two integers m and n using the following algorithm:
a. Let m = m âˆ’ n and swap m and n if m < n after subtraction.
b. Repeat step (a) until n is 0. The greatest common divisor is m. Test your pro-
grams with the following pairs of data: 9 and 12; 7 and 11; and 12 and 140.

PRG-11. Writeaprogramthatreadsalistofscoresbetween0and100andfindsand prints the smallest and the largest scores. The program needs to ask for the number of the scores from the user; this number must be less than or equal to 10.
