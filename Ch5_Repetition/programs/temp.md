PRG-5. Write a program that asks the user to enter two positive integers. The program then prints a list of even and a list of odd numbers between the given integers.

PRG-6. Write a program that prints all numbers between 1 and 100 that are divisible by 7.

PRG-7. Write a program that prints all numbers between 1 and 100 that are divisible by
both 5 and 7.

PRG-8. Write a program that reads a positive integer between 1 and 100 and prints its factors (divisors). A factor is a number that divides another number. For example, the factors of 10 are 1, 2, 5, and 10. The factors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12.

PRG-9. Write a program that reads two integers between 1 and 100 and prints their common factors (divisors).

PRG-10. Write a program that finds the greatest common divisor of two integers m and n using the following algorithm:
a. Let m = m âˆ’ n and swap m and n if m < n after subtraction.
b. Repeat step (a) until n is 0. The greatest common divisor is m. Test your proxgrams with the following pairs of data: 9 and 12; 7 and 11; and 12 and 140.

PRG-11. Write a program that reads a list of scores between 0 and 100 and finds and prints the smallest and the largest scores. The program needs to ask for the number of the scores from the user; this number must be less than or equal to 10.

PRG-12. Write a program to display the leap years in the years 2000 to 2099. A leap year is a year that is divisible by 4, but if it is divisible by 100, it should also be divisible by 400.
PRG-13. Write a program that asks the user to enter a positive integer. The program then prints the sum of the digits.
PRG-14. Write a program that asks the user to enter a positive integer. The program then prints the integer in reverse order. For example, if the user enters 359, the program prints 953.
PRG-15. Write a program that asks the user to enter a positive integer. The program then checks to see if the number is a palindrome. A palindrome integer is an integer that is the same when the order of digits is reversed. For example, 353 and 376673 are palindromes. Hint: Use the result of the program in PRG-14.
PRG-16. Write a program that creates a table of Celsius/Fahrenheit conversions between 0 and 99 degree Celsius. The conversion formula is as follows:
Fahrenheit = Celcius * 180.0 / 100.0 + 32
